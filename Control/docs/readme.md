# Welcome to The Control Systems Module of Project SENTINEL
# About

This module contains the code necessary to control the rocket via its control surfaces.

Control surfaces are essential for the safe and successful flight of a rocket. They allow the rocket to be steered to its target, maintain stability during flight, and compensate for disturbances such as wind gusts. Without control surfaces, a rocket would be unable to fly accurately or safely.

When a control surface is deflected, it changes the direction of the airflow around the rocket. This change in airflow creates a force that acts on the rocket, causing it to rotate or translate in the desired direction.
